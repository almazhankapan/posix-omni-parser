<Purpose>
  This module contains the Trace object, which is used to capture all the
  extracted information from a trace file.

  Example using this module:

    import Trace
    trace = Trace.Trace(path_to_trace)
    print trace

class Trace(object):
    """
    <Purpose>
      This object represents an entire system call trace, which means that it 
      holds all the information extracted from a system call trace file created by
      an interposition utility such as the strace utility on Linux, the truss 
      utility on Solaris or the dtrace utility on BSD and OSX platforms.
    
    <Attributes>
      self.trace_path:
        The path to the file containing the traced system calls.
      
      self.tracing_utility:
        The detected tracing utility used to generate the trace file, e.g strace.
      
      self.parser:
        The parser to use in order to extract the information from the trace file.
        The choice of parser depends on the tracing utility used to generate the 
        trace file, i.e self.tracing_utility.
    
      self.syscalls:
        This variable holds all the parsed system calls. It is a list of Syscall
        objects returned by the parser.
    
      self.platform:
        The platform in which the trace is parsed on (sys.platform). This is
        especially useful when creating a trace bundle containing not only the
        parsed system calls but also a representation of all the files referenced
        in trace file.
